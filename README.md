# About me

  I've been a Ruby on Rails developer since October 2021. During my time, I've worked with PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby on Rails to build SaaS Applications following Agile Development patterns. These efforts have involved managing live databases carefully and learning new patterns at a fast pace. I've contributed to several Open Source Repositories, including [Turbo Confirm](https://github.com/RoleModel/turbo-confirm).
