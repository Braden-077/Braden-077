# About me

Hello, my name is Braden Rich. I graduated Concord Christian School as their class of 2021. Since graduation, I have refined my coding skills in Ruby, Rails, HTML, CSS, and (more recently) JavaScript. I am currently (06/01/22 start) attending the `RoleModel Software Craftsmanship Academy`. 

I am always open to building new exciting apps, fixing old ones, and all around improving on my skills.
