# About me

  I've been a Ruby on Rails developer since October 2021. During my time, I've worked with Postgresql, Software as a Service, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Continuous Integration through Semaphore CI and GitHub Actions, app   deployments via Heroku, and managing live databases. I've contributed to several Open Source Repositories, including [Turbo Confirm](https://github.com/RoleModel/turbo-confirm).
